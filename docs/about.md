I'm a senior at Wesleyan University studying computer science. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, running with flat shoes, and reading about economics. When not in Middletown, I live in Montclair, NJ. 

Right now, I'm working at [privacy-tech-lab](https://www.privacytechlab.org/) on a privacy focused browser extension, [Privacy Pioneer](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/privacy-pioneer). Give it a try!
